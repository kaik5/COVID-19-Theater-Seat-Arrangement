# COVID19-Theater-Seating-Arrangement-Algorithm
This program uses an algorithm to find an optimal pattern to seat guests in the Coronavirus time and prints it out. The theather is in a n * m dimension where n is the number of rows and m is the number of seats. The seat moves circularly, like Knight's Tour, and it checks the Euclidean vertical, horizontal, diagonal distance between two seats. The value of 1 on the pattern indicate somebody should seat there, 0 otherwise.
